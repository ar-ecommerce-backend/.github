# E-Commerce Microservices Platform Infrastructure

Welcome to the foundational infrastructure repository for a production-grade, microservices-based e-commerce backend built with **Java Spring Boot**. This project is a personal initiative to gain hands-on experience designing scalable distributed systems, applying real-world DevOps practices, and building enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines.

This GitHub organization hosts the **core infrastructure**, **shared tooling**, and **operational backbone** enabling secure, maintainable development and deployment for a modern e-commerce backend.

## 📌 Why This Project?

I created this platform to simulate the kind of architecture and workflows used by real-world engineering teams. The goals include:

- Practicing microservice design patterns using Spring Boot
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions
- Managing secrets, configs, and observability like a production system
- Applying infrastructure-as-code with Docker, Helm, and Terraform
- Gaining experience with system design, integration testing, and monitoring

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

This platform follows best practices in **microservices architecture**, **DevOps automation**, and **observability** to support a reliable and modular e-commerce system.

### Core Capabilities

- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT-based auth with RBAC
- **User Management:** Profile and account details
- **Product & Inventory:** Catalog and stock tracking
- **Order & Payment:** Checkout and payment orchestration
- **Notifications:** Email and SMS event triggers
- **API Gateway:** Unified entry point with throttling and auth checks
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamic registry with Eureka
- **Centralized Config:** Externalized config via Spring Cloud Config
- **Secrets Management:** Vault-integrated secrets and templated `.env`s
- **Observability:** ELK stack with structured logging
- **CI/CD:** Reusable GitHub Actions for linting, testing, security, and Docker publishing

---

## 🧰 Tooling & Infrastructure

- **Local Dev:** Docker Compose environment with PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and all services
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions with reusable workflow templates
- **Testing:** Unit, integration (Testcontainers), coverage, and OWASP scanning
- **Monitoring & Logging:** ELK Stack, future Datadog/Prometheus support
- **Infra-as-Code:** Docker, Helm, and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
